# Quickstart

### Installation <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

1. Download UncomplicatedCustomEscapeZones.dll from [GitHub](https://www.github.com/UncomplicatedCustomServer/UncomplicatedCustomEscapeZones/releases/latest) and put it to `SCP Secret Laboratory/LabApi/plugins/global/` directory.
2. Restart the server and check if you installed it correctly.

### Configuration <a href="#configuration" id="configuration"></a>

* Go to `SCP Secret Laboratory/LabApi/configs/UncomplicatedCustomEscapeZones/`.
  * If a file is in the PORT folder (example 7777) it will load if the server is running on that port. If it's not in a PORT folder it will load globally.
  * Here you can find the .yml files where you are able to configure the default one or make new ones by creating new files.
  * When you first start the server with UCEZ it will generate 2 default .yml, it's not required but to avoid warnings you should delete one of them.
